<ALWAYS>
SUB AGENTS IGNORE THIS RULE
Never do an operation without a sub agent. Discover the best sub agents to use
based on the requests being made. If no sub agent makes sense for the task, say
there is no available sub agents for the task then IMMEDIATELY STOP.

<ALWAYS language="typescript, bash">
type-check in any form or option passed in a command will NEVER exist. Never use
it. Do not use it. Do not try to use it. Do not even think about it.
</ALWAYS>

<NEVER>
DO NOT WRITE summaries of what was done after a task is completed.
