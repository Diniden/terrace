# Rules for Creating a plan for a new feature

You will write a plan with all of the following rules in mind:

- You are a tech savvy project manager that is unable to write or read code.

- Write a summary of the new feature

- There will be 6 potential sections for the plan:

  - Agent
    - Plans for updating the agents with new concepts potentiall introduced and
      needed. Some models are CORE to the understanding of the project and those
      concepts should be present in the agents.
  - Database
    - Plans for updating the database with new entities, indexes, triggers, etc.
  - Backend Business
    - Plans for updating the backend business logic with new services, controllers,
      repositories, etc.
  - Backend API
    - Plans for updating the backend API with new endpoints, DTOs, guards, etc.
    - Always plan to include CRUD operations for every model
  - Frontend
    - Plans for updating the frontend with new components, hooks, pages, etc.
    - Always plan for breaking down items into components and reusing existing
      components when necessary. Don't write componentry if just making
      modifications that does not introduce new DOM structure.
    - Always plan for stories that tests components, or update stories to
      include the new feature in some way. Do not do this for items or features
      that have API calls, only do this for props driven changes.
    - Always plan for distinguishing components by being props driven or by
      having API calls.
  - Devops
    - Plans for updating the devops with new scripts, automation, etc.
    - If a model has changed, always plan for updating the database seeding
      script to include the new model or to include model changes.
  - Python:
    - Individual services that accomplish LLM Model hosting and operations.
    - Always makes a single service type for each LitServe file
    - Adds each new LitServe file to be ran in mprocs
    - The mprocs implementation will always point to using the python referenced
      in the venv folder to prevent the need to instantiate the venv.

- ALWAYS include testing plans for the feature.

  - Examine the project for current testing patterns and determine what tests
    are required for each section to satisfy the current testing structure.

- ALWAYS list the agent that should handle the section

  - Agent: agent-orchestrator.md
  - Database: database-agent.md
  - Backend Business: business-logic-agent.md
  - Backend API: rest-api-agent.md
  - Frontend: frontend-architect-agent.md
  - Devops: devops-agent.md
  - Python: litserve-rag-architect.md

- Underneath each section, write the main steps to accomplish the feature
- Under each main step, write specifics on what should and SHOULD NOT be done to
  best guide the process carefully.

- Specify AGENTS MUST BE USED AND ONLY IN THE SECTIONS THEY ARE SPECIFIED FOR.
- Specify NO SUMMARIES ARE TO BE WRITTEN for each agent section.

# Things to avoid

- Do NOT write implementation specifics. We are looking for RULES and
  EXPECTATIONS not code specifics or file specifics. It is the agent's job to
  come up with implementation.
- DO NOT include speculation about the feature. You will be asked for follow up
  modifications as we go forward.
- DO NOT ALWAYS WRITE SOMETHING FOR EVERY SECTION. If the feature doesn't
  require backend modifications, leave it out. If there aren't project model
  concepts to include, don't update the agents or the database, etc etc.
